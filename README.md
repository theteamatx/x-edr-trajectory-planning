This repository contains an implementation of the trajectory planning method described in the following paper:

F. Pfeiffer and R. Johanni, "A concept for manipulator trajectory planning," Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, San Francisco, CA, USA, 1986, pp. 1399-1405, doi: 10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087500.

It also contains an implementation of b-splines curves and high-level classes to
fit b-splines to joint-space and Cartesian-space paths and compute timed
trajectories.
