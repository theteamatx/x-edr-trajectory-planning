This is a C++ library for planning robot trajectories, mainly composed of three components:

* An implementation of B-splines curves, in joint-space and Cartesian space.
* High-level classes to fit B-splines to sparse joint-space and Cartesian-space paths.
* An implementation of the trajectory planning method described in this paper:
